<h3>What is Debugging</h3>
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in a program. The term originated from Admiral Grace Hopper in 1947, when her colleagues found a moth in the Harvard computer and she said they were ‘debugging’ it.

<h3>Types of errors:</h3>
- **Syntax:** A mistake in the code rules
- **User:** A mistake made by the person using the program
- **Runtime:**Error that happens while the program is running
- **Logic:** When the code runs but gives the wrong result because of a mistake in thinking or calculations.

<h3>Steps to Debugging</h3>
There are 6 common steps taken when debugging code. 
- **Clarify the code’s purpose:** What is the code trying to accomplish?
- **Identify the problem:** Figure out what isn’t working.
- **Locate the source:** Find the part of the code causing the error.
- **Identify the type of error:** Determine if it’s syntax, logic, runtime, or user error.
- **Fix the error:** Correct the mistake in the code.
- **Test the solution:** Run the program to make sure it works correctly.

<h2>Example 1</h2>
```python
text = "Hello, world, my name is "
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char == " ":
       count += 1

print(count)
```
In order to debug the code for this example we follow the steps to debugging.
