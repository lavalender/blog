<p>This summer was my last summer before being an adult, and I have to say it was one of my best summers. This summer I mostly worked but I feel like I matured and changed even though I only worked. Before the summer, I had already made a lot of changes in my life. I lost a friend and after self reflecting and realizing why, I really wanted to work on myself and just try to become the person I want to be.

<p> After my junior trip, a few weeks after, I got into the worst job I've ever had(I mean I’ve only had 2 jobs but still), Walgreens. And no it wasn't because I was working at a Walgreens, at the end of the day I was okay with wherever I worked as long as I made money for the summer. Instead it was because of my managers. Some of the managers there were so stressful and just too much especially for my first job in retail. The moment I walked into work every day I would dread that this one manager wasn’t there because all she would do was yell at people all the time. I mean it was exhausting and would just reflect on my mood. She would just give us a hard time even though we barely knew what to do and literally just got into the job. I also learned that retail really wasn’t the job for me. Always being up and walking around especially in a small store was exhausting. Even just restocking products, my lower back was already kind of weak so bending down to restock objects and walking around really made it work. However, besides the multiple struggles I made so many friends that made my experience better. On the first day of work, I saw this girl on the bus and soon realized that she was also working with me because of what she was wearing. Because I was too scared to say anything, all I could think about in my mind was how bad I wanted to be her friend. She was such a cool looking person. After like the second week, I finally got the courage to talk to her, me and her immediately clicked and had so many common interests. After that we literally were never apart. We even ended up changing our schedules and going to the time and days as each other. Overall though I made so many friends while working there and had such an amazing time when we would work in the photo department. Like I really loved our little group that would work in the photo department(my favorite department).

<p>To end my summer with my family, my family and I went to Splish Splash on Labor Day. When we got there, the parking lot was nearly empty because everyone was out celebrating Labor Day. However it was a kind of cold and windy day especially when you have only a bathing suit on. My brother, sister, and I went to literally all the rides when we were there like we made sure to scan out the map and go on all the rides. My favorite rides from this water park had to be Alien Invasion, Bombs Away, and Bootlegger's Run. All three of those rides were listed as the most intense rides they had there and I just loved them. Even though we didn’t travel far, I still really enjoyed the trip and had fun. </p>

<p>Sadly, during my summer job in June I lost my grandma. My grandma has been one of the most important people to me in my life and loved me as much as I loved her. She had pictures of me graduating kindergarten in her house and even had my birthday as her passcode to her phone. I have so many memories of her and I wish we could’ve made more and also made it to my graduation, 18th birthday or maybe even my wedding. She passed away in the presence of my mother thankfully and we held a funeral for her the week after her death. I got to see many of my family members that I hadn’t seen in a while or that were living in a different country entirely. It was really a beautiful but sad moment where we connected as a family again as my grandma was the main person who always brought us together.
