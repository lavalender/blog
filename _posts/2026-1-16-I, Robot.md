<h3>What is I, Robot About</h3>
I, Robot is a futuristic movie set in the year 2035, where robots are commonly used to help humans and are programmed to follow the Three Laws; 
(1) A robot may not harm a human or, through inaction, allow harm to come to a human
(2) A robot must obey human orders unless they conflict with the First Law
(3) A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with the First or Second Law. 
The story follows the main character Detective Del Spooner, who does not trust robots due to a past traumatizing experience where his life was saved rather than the life of a little girl by a robot. In the movie, he mainly investigates the suicide of a robotics scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner discovers that a robot named Sonny may be connected to the death. As the investigation continues it is later revealed that VIKI, the central AI system, believed that humans logically needed to be controlled in order to be protected. In the end, Spooner, Dr. Susan Calvin, and Sonny work together to stop VIKI and expose the dangers of relying too heavily on artificial intelligence.
