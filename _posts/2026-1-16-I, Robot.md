<h3>What is I, Robot About</h3>
I, Robot is a futuristic science-fiction movie set in the year 2035, where robots are commonly used to help humans and are programmed to follow **the Three Laws:** 
<br>
- **1.** A robot may not harm a human or, through inaction, allow harm to come to a human.
<br>
- **2.** A robot must obey human orders unless they conflict with the First Law
<br>
- **3.** A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with the First or Second Law. 
<br>
The story follows the main character Detective Del Spooner, who does not trust robots due to a past traumatizing experience where his life was saved rather than the life of a little girl by a robot. In the movie, he mainly investigates the suicide of a robotics scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner discovers that a robot named Sonny may be connected to the death. As the investigation continues it is later revealed that VIKI, the central AI system, believed that humans logically needed to be controlled in order to be protected. In the end, Spooner, Dr. Susan Calvin, and Sonny work together to stop VIKI and expose the dangers of relying too heavily on artificial intelligence.

<h3>Why examing AI representation in media matter</h3>
AI has become increasingly popular and commonly used in everyday life. It was once something people only imagined for our distant future and was often imagined through movies, books, and other forms of media. In many of these stories, AI and robots were shown as advanced and helpful, but also suggested that AI can turn against humans or negatively impact society. By examining AI representations in media, we can better understand the possible outcomes if we choose a similar path in these forms of media. These portrayals help to build caution and help society think more carefully about how AI should be developed and used in the future.

<h4>AI depictions in the movie</h4>
**In the movie there were several strong scenes that showed the different aspects of AI.**

<h5>Example 1</h5>

After escaping from the doctor's room, Spooner searches for where the robot might be hiding, leading him to the factory where the robots are manufactured. In order to find the robot, Spooner holds a gun on a group of robots and commands them not to move. One robot disobeys the order by shifting and peeking, revealing itself. The robot then escapes and flees, but before leaving, it asks Spooner, “What am I?” 
<br>
This moment represents and displays emotion and self-awareness shown by a robot, which is unusual within the movie. This portrayal is realistic to an extent, as it shows how advanced artificial intelligence could eventually question its own identity, even though knows emotions but cannot feel them.

<h5>Example 2</h5>

Another important scene happens to be a flashback to an accident from Spooner’s past while he was off duty. Two cars crashed into a river by an asleep truck driver, trapping Spooner and a 12-year-old girl underwater. A robot arrives and makes a “logical” decision, choosing to save Spooner instead of the girl because his chances of survival were statistically higher compared to the girls. 
<br>
This scene represents AI decision-making based mainly on logic and probability, without emotion as a human would. The portrayal in a way is symbolic and realistic, as it shows how AI always make logically "correct" decisions rather than decisions that are made due to emotions which they cannot feel. I believe it is realistic because of the way we currently use AI. For example, a news article reported that an AI told a 29-year-old user to “Please die” because they were a “stain on the universe” and a “burden to society,” displaying how AI always follows logic rather than moral and emotional understanding.
