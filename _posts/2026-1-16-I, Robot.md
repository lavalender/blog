<h3>What is I, Robot About</h3>
I, Robot is a futuristic science-fiction movie set in the year 2035, where robots are commonly used to help humans and are programmed to follow **the Three Laws:** 
<br>
- **1.** A robot may not harm a human or, through inaction, allow harm to come to a human.
<br>
- **2.** A robot must obey human orders unless they conflict with the First Law
<br>
- **3.** A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with the First or Second Law. 
<br>
<br>
The story follows the main character Detective Del Spooner, who does not trust robots due to a past traumatizing experience where his life was saved rather than the life of a little girl by a robot. In the movie, he mainly investigates the suicide of a robotics scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner discovers that a robot named Sonny may be connected to the death. As the investigation continues it is later revealed that VIKI, the central AI system, believed that humans logically needed to be controlled in order to be protected. In the end, Spooner, Dr. Susan Calvin, and Sonny work together to stop VIKI and expose the dangers of relying too heavily on artificial intelligence.

<h3>Why examing AI representation in media matter</h3>
AI has become increasingly popular and commonly used in everyday life. It was once something people only imagined for our distant future and was often imagined through movies, books, and other forms of media. In many of these stories, AI and robots were shown as advanced and helpful, but also suggested that AI can turn against humans or negatively impact society. By examining AI representations in media, we can better understand the possible outcomes if we choose a similar path in these forms of media. These portrayals help to build caution and help society think more carefully about how AI should be developed and used in the future.

<h4>AI depictions in the movie</h4>
**In the movie there were several strong scenes that showed the different aspects of AI.**

<h5>Example 1</h5>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/filmquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/robot11.jpg" alt="I, Robot Peaking Scene">
After escaping from the doctor's room, Spooner searches for where the robot might be hiding, leading him to the factory where the robots are manufactured. In order to find the robot, Spooner holds a gun on a group of robots and commands them not to move. One robot disobeys the order by shifting and peeking, revealing itself. The robot then escapes and flees, but before leaving, it asks Spooner, “What am I?” 
<br>
<br>
This moment represents and displays emotion and self-awareness shown by a robot, which is unusual within the movie. This portrayal is realistic to an extent, as it shows how advanced artificial intelligence could eventually question its own identity, even though knows emotions but cannot feel them.

<h5>Example 2</h5>

Another important scene happens to be a flashback to an accident from Spooner’s past while he was off duty. Two cars crashed into a river by an asleep truck driver, trapping Spooner and a 12-year-old girl underwater. A robot arrives and makes a “logical” decision, choosing to save Spooner instead of the girl because his chances of survival were statistically higher compared to the girls. 
<br>
<br>
This scene represents AI decision-making based mainly on logic and probability, without emotion as a human would. The portrayal in a way is symbolic and realistic, as it shows how AI always make logically "correct" decisions rather than decisions that are made due to emotions which they cannot feel. I believe it is realistic because of the way we currently use AI. For example, a news article reported that an AI told a 29-year-old user to “Please die” because they were a “stain on the universe” and a “burden to society,” displaying how AI always follows logic rather than moral and emotional understanding.

<h5>Example 3</h5>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*5SYIuZEkBa49r88mvK7Hng.jpeg" alt="I, Robot V.I.K.I">
In the scene where Spooner and Dr. Calvin reach VIKI’s core, they find that it was VIKI who had behind it all. She calmly explains that she was created to help humans by following the Three Laws of Robotics. She argues that humans cannot be trusted to protect themselves, and in order to fully obey the First Law in all its complexity, she must control humanity, even if it harms people. She says that freedom is dangerous and that temporary control is necessary for humanity’s survival. As she speaks, all of the robots across the city enforce her orders and in the process hurt many civilian lives. 
<br>
<br>
This moment represents AI decision-making as well as her relationship with humans to an extreme. Because of all the knowledge that she grasped and understood on extreme level, she developed a new understanding of human behavior and the world as well as what she would need to do in order to follow the Three Laws of Robotics to the best of her ability. I believe that this scene is symbolic and realistic as it highlights the risks of giving AI too much authority, power and knowledge.

<h5>Example 4</h5>
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l8rRuPXSi5I/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="I, Robot V.I.K.I Shutdown">
The final important scene occurs when Spooner, Dr. Susan Calvin, and Sonny confront VIKI in order to shut her down. During the fight, a robot breaks part of the platform Dr. Calvin is standing on, leaving her hanging and about to fall. Spooner immediately orders Sonny to save her. Sonny hesitates briefly, weighing the logical importance of completing the mission against the immediate danger to a human life. In that moment, Sonny chooses to save Dr. Calvin while also handing the shutdown device to Spooner, allowing both goals to be achieved. This scene also highlights the contrast between Sonny and other robots, showing his ability to combine logic with emotions and make decisions that align with human values. It directly contrasts with the earlier drowning scene, where a robot chose logic over emotion, demonstrating Sonny’s more human-like decision-making.
<br>
<br>
This moment represents AI emotions, its relationship with humans, and decision-making. Unlike most other robots in the film, Sonny is shown as different and more human-like, as he displays emotions such as fear, makes decisions to save people he cares about, and shows concern for others. This is further emphasized when Sonny asks Spooner after the fight if they are now “friends,” highlighting his ability to build emotional connections with humans. I believe this portrayal is both symbolic and a bit exaggerated, as it shows what could possibly happen if AI were able to “feel” emotions, even though this may never be possible in the real world.
