Hello
<img src="/blog/images/pink.jpg" alt= "Pinkpantheress">
<p>This summer was my last summer before being an adult, and I have to say it was one of my best summers. This summer I mostly worked but I feel like I matured and changed even though I only worked. Before the summer, I had already made a lot of changes in my life. I lost a friend and after self reflecting and realizing why, I really wanted to work on myself and just try to become the person I want to be.
